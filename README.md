# 0NYX's portable forensics laboratory
## Introduction
I have recently started taking interest in cybersecurity, especially the fields of forensic analysis and OSINT, and I wanted to make a tool to suit my demands. I wanted to have a portable tool, which would fit my demands, without the hassle of downloading a million programs. 
## Features
The laboratory will include 2 branches of tools, and those being file analysis tools and registry analysis tools. These are the 2 branches planned for the near future, because they fit the vision of this project, because on the go you mostly need tools for data extraction and visualization.
### Files analysis
