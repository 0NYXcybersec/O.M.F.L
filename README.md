# 0NYX's portable forensics laboratory
## Introduction
I have recently started taking interest in cybersecurity, especially the fields of forensic analysis and OSINT, and I wanted to make a tool to suit my demands. I wanted to have a portable tool, which would fit my demands, which I could play with, without the hassle of downloading a million programs. Because of that I decided to develop my own tool, for everyone to also play with.
## Features
The laboratory will include 2 branches of tools, and those being file analysis tools and registry analysis tools.
### Files analysis
