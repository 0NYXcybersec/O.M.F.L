# 0NYX's portable forensics laboratory
## Introduction
I have recently started taking interest in cybersecurity, especially the fields of forensic analysis and OSINT, and I wanted to learn the basics of forensics. I wanted to have a tool which I could play with, without the hassle of downloading a million programs. Because of that I decided to develop my own tool, for everyone to also play with and learn forensics.
## Features
The laboratory will include 3 branches of tools, and those being network tools, file analysis tools, and registry analysis tools.
### Network tools

### Files analysis

### Registry analysis

## Stages of this project
```python
CURRENTLY : STAGE ONE
```
### Stage one
At stage one my main goal is to develop the tools itself. This is because I think its important to know the in's and out's of each tool before implementing them all together. 
### Stage two
At the start of stage one I am planning to implement the tools into O.P.F.L and make it usable, and if everything wents accordingly I plan to release a step by step guide and documentation for the script.
### Stage three
Stage three will be the final stage. Stage three will bring much more tools like network scanners and other tools. Stage three, unlike one and two, wont come fully equipped out of the box. Stage three will work like a framework for everyone to add the tools they want to learn using.
